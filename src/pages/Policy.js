                    <h4>Automatic Collection of Non-Personal Information</h4>
                    <p className='policy_text'>When you visit and use the Helendo, like when you visit most
                        other websites,
                        certain non-personal information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include
                        information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you
                        access the internet, the date and time you access the Helendo, the pages you
                        access while at the Helendo, and the internet address of the website, if any, from
                        which you linked directly to the Helendo. This information is not personally
                        identifiable.</p>
                    <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
                    <p className='policy_text'>“Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that concerns
                        you individually and would
                        permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, email
                        address, Social Security number or similar or any information you submitted to Helendothat
                        identifies you individually.

                        We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it.

                        not submit it.

                        You can visit and browse Helendo without revealing personally identifiable
                        information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information

                    <p className='policy_text'>Helendo does not provide personally identifiable information to
                        unaffiliated third parties
                        for their use in marketing directly to you. We may use unaffiliated companies to help us
                        maintain and operate our website or for other reasons related to the operation of its business,
                        and those companies may receive your personally identifiable information for that purpose. We
                        may also disclose personally identifiable information about you in connection with legal
                        requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, governmental request or
                        investigation, or as otherwise permitted by law. Finally, as RoomSketcher’s business develops,
                        Helendomay sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions customer information may
                        be one of the transferred business assets. If RoomSketcher, its internet businesses, or
                        substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets
                        transferred.</p>

                        Helendo, if such termination is deemed necessary by us in order for us to operate

                    <h4>“Cookies” and Advertisers</h4>
                    <p className='policy_text'>RoomSketcher’s servers, or the servers of companies that are used to
                        operate the RoomSketcher

                        recognize your computer while you are on its website and help customize your online experience
                        and make it more convenient for you. Cookies are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in
                        for users, tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions. The
